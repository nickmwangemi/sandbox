## Studio Ghibli App

This is a simple web app that connects to an API, retrieves data using JavaScript and displays it on a website.
This app makes use of the Studio Ghibli API(v1.0.1) available at [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#)

The steps involved in the making of this app were made available on this tutorial by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).

The tutorial is available [here](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/).

- Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/nickmwangemi/sandbox.git

```

- Open index.html in your favourite modern browser.
